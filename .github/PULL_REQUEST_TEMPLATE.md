<!--

Thanks for the PR. Please complete the checklist below to ensure your PR can be
merged as soon as possible.

Adding a changeset using `yarn changeset` is required if you've modified a
source file in `packages`. Please be brief and descriptive. For breaking
changes, use a major changeset. For new features, use a minor changeset. For
bug fixes, use a patch changeset.

Changes to component files inside `apps/www/src/registry` don't require a
changeset, but please update the component changelog to briefly describe what
you changed. See `apps/www/content/docs/components/changelog.mdx`.
